# Deploying a Tic-Tac-Toe Web App using Machine Learning

## Overview
This is the final part of a three-part project to develop a web app utilizing machine learning that could read the board state of a Tic-Tac-Toe (sometimes referred to as Noughts and Crosses) game from a picture and provide a recommended move to the user. In Part 1, I utilized reinforcement learning to train a neural network to play Tic-Tac-Toe optimally. In Part 2, I trained a convolutional neural network to extract a Tic-Tac-Toe board state from an image. In this part, Part 3, those trained networks are deployed to Google Cloud as a web app usable from (theoretically) any device.
